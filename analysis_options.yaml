# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# If 'package:flutter_lints' isn't available in the environment, keep a small
# in-repo rule set to avoid analyzer errors. Replace this with the full
# Flutter lints package in CI or when available.
